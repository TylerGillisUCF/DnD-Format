# MODIFIER CALCULATION

The number of points in a stat determines your MODIFIER - the bonus (or penalty) you add to dice rolls.

# HOW IT WORKS

When you roll a die for something related to a stat, you ADD the modifier to your roll.

# MODIFIER CHART

# EXAMPLE IN PLAY

# SCENARIO

Nick needs to lift a heavy portcullis to escape.

## 📋 DM: "Nick, this is a test of raw strength! Roll a d20 and add your Strength modifier!"

# NICK'S STATS:

Strength: 10 points → +2 modifier

### NICK ROLLS: Gets a 14 on the d20

# TOTAL RESULT: 14 + 2 = 16

## 📋 DM: "You needed a 15 to succeed. With a mighty heave, the portcullis rises! You're through!"

[DM TIP: Always tell players what they're rolling BEFORE they roll, and what stat to add. "Roll d10 plus your Dexterity!" This keeps things clear.]

# THE COIN ECONOMY

This campaign features a carefully balanced economy of 240 TOTAL COINS circulating throughout the adventure. Every coin matters, and players must make strategic choices about when to spend and when to save.

### COIN SOURCES (Income)

# STARTING COINS

12 coins per player (36 total)

## ⚔️ CAMEO ENCOUNTER REWARDS

5 coins after completing each cameo

36 cameo encounters × 5 coins = 180 coins total

Guaranteed income - everyone gets these!

# NATURAL 20 BONUS

+1 coin whenever you roll a natural 20 (the die shows 20 before adding modifiers)

Estimated ~12-24 bonus coins across the campaign

Pure luck - celebrate these moments!

## ⚔️ ENCOUNTER REWARDS

> ⚠️ Various challenges offer coin rewards

Estimated ~12-20 additional coins available

These require smart play or risk-taking

[DM TIP: Track coins carefully. Have players mark circles on their character sheets as they gain/spend coins.]

### COIN COSTS (Mandatory Expenses)

## ⚔️ MEAL ENCOUNTERS

5 total meals during the journey

### 2 FREE MEALS - Found food, hospitality, or luck

### 3 PAID MEALS - 5 coins each (15 coins total per player)

### MANDATORY - Characters must eat! These are story moments, not optional

### TOTAL MANDATORY SPENDING: 15 coins per player minimum

### COIN COSTS (Optional Expenses)

# VENDOR ITEMS

3-15 coins each

> ⚠️ Magic items that help with dice rolls

Reroll tokens, bonus modifiers, special abilities

Strategic purchases that can make encounters easier

## ⚔️ RANDOM ENCOUNTER OPTIONS

2-10 coins

Gambling opportunities

Information purchases

Shortcut payments

# HIGH-RISK OPPORTUNITIES

Variable costs

> ⚠️ Bigger risks, bigger rewards

Can gain OR lose coins based on rolls

# COIN PENALTIES

# NATURAL 1 PENALTY

-1 coin when you roll a natural 1 on the die

## ⚔️ EXCEPTION: NO coin loss during combat encounters

Only applies to non-combat rolls

Bad luck tax!

# FAILED HIGH-RISK ATTEMPTS

-3 coins

When you try a difficult steal, gamble, or risky action and fail

You lose the opportunity AND pay a price

## ⚔️ SPECIFIC ENCOUNTER FAILURES

Variable

Some encounters have coin penalties for certain choices

Always clearly explained before you choose

# ECONOMY PHILOSOPHY

# THE BALANCE

> ⚠️ Players should always feel like they can afford SOMETHING at each vendor or opportunity, but must make strategic choices about expensive items.

### Example Player Journey

### Start: 12 coins

## ⚔️ After 6 cameos: 12 + 30 = 42 coins

### Minus 1 paid meal: 37 coins

> ⚠️ Can afford most vendor items (3-10 coins) OR save for legendary items (15 coins)

## ⚔️ After 12 cameos: ~67 coins

Plenty for strategic purchases while still having reserves

[DM TIP: If a player is completely broke and can't participate in a vendor encounter, let them find 2-3 coins on the path. The goal is fun, not punishment!]

# TRACKING COINS

# FOR PLAYERS

Character sheets have coin circles to mark

Fill in circles as you gain coins

Cross out circles as you spend coins

Current total = filled circles minus crossed circles

# FOR DM

Keep a master list of each player's coins

Update after every encounter

Announce clearly: "You gain 5 coins!" or "That costs 8 coins"

Make coin changes feel significant and earned

[DM TIP: Make gaining coins feel GOOD. When they complete a cameo, say "You've earned 5 coins! Mark them on your sheet. You now have [total] coins!" Celebration matters!]

# DICE MECHANICS

This campaign uses the full range of D&D dice to keep things varied and interesting. Different situations call for different dice!

# THE DICE FAMILY

### d4 (four-sided) - Small, quick checks

Minor tasks with little consequence

Simple decisions

### Example: "Which path looks safer?"

### d6 (six-sided) - Standard checks

Common actions

Moderate difficulty tasks

### Example: "Can you spot the trap?"

### d8 (eight-sided) - Skilled checks

Tasks requiring some expertise

Moderate-to-hard challenges

### Example: "Decode this ancient text"

### d10 (ten-sided) - Challenging checks

Difficult actions

Important moments

### Example: "Convince the guard to let you pass"

### d12 (twelve-sided) - Major checks

Very difficult actions

High-stakes moments

### Example: "Lift the massive boulder blocking your path"

### d20 (twenty-sided) - Epic checks

Critical moments

Boss encounters

Climactic challenges

### Example: "Strike the final blow against the Void Tyrant!"

[DM TIP: Match the die to the drama. Epic moments deserve d20s. Quick decisions can be d4s. This creates narrative rhythm!]

# HOW TO ROLL

### STEP 1: DM announces what's being tested

"This is a Strength check!"

"Roll for Dexterity!"

"This requires Intelligence!"

### STEP 2: DM tells player which die to roll

"Roll a d10!"

"Give me a d20!"

"Roll d6!"

### STEP 3: Player rolls the die and announces result

"I got a 12!"

### STEP 4: Player adds their relevant stat modifier

"My Strength modifier is +2, so that's 14 total!"

### STEP 5: DM compares to target number (DC = Difficulty Class)

Easy tasks: DC 6-8

Medium tasks: DC 9-11

Hard tasks: DC 12-14

Very Hard tasks: DC 15-17

Nearly Impossible: DC 18+

### STEP 6: DM describes the outcome

### Success: "You accomplish the task!"

### Failure: "It doesn't work, but here's what happens instead..."

[DM TIP: You don't always have to reveal the DC beforehand. Sometimes it's more dramatic to let them roll and then reveal if they succeeded!]

### NATURAL 20s AND NATURAL 1s

### NATURAL 20 (Critical Success)

When the die itself shows 20 (before adding modifiers)

Automatic success, often with bonus effects!

> ⚠️ Player gains +1 coin as a reward

### CELEBRATE THIS! High-fives, cheers, excitement!

Example: "Natural 20! Not only do you pick the lock, you do it so smoothly that you find a hidden compartment with treasure inside! Plus you gain 1 coin!"

### NATURAL 1 (Critical Failure)

When the die itself shows 1 (before adding modifiers)

Automatic failure, often with funny consequences

Player loses 1 coin (EXCEPT in combat - no coin loss in fights!)

### LAUGH TOGETHER! These make the best stories

Example: "Natural 1! You try to climb the wall but your hand slips, and you slide back down, landing in a mud puddle. Everyone nearby tries not to laugh. You lose 1 coin as you fish it out of the mud!"

[DM TIP: Make Natural 1s funny, not punishing. The coin loss is enough - make the narrative outcome amusing, embarrassing, or slapstick, never truly harmful!]

## ⚔️ COMBAT MECHANICS

Combat in this campaign is streamlined and exciting - no tracking roll outcomes, armor class, or roll penalties. Instead, combat is resolved through opposed rolls and best-of-X matches!

## ⚔️ COMBAT STRUCTURE

## ⚔️ BASIC COMBAT FORMAT

Hero rolls vs. Enemy rolls

Highest total wins that exchange

First to win X exchanges wins the combat

X varies by encounter (best of 3, best of 5, etc.)

## ⚔️ NO COIN LOSS IN COMBAT

Even if you roll a Natural 1 in combat, you don't lose a coin

Combat is challenging enough without economic penalties!

This encourages brave, heroic action

## ⚔️ Example Combat

> **DM NOTE:** DM: "The bandit challenges you to a duel! Best of 3 exchanges - first to win 2 wins the fight! Roll d10 plus Strength!"

### Exchange 1: Hero 14, Bandit 11 → Hero wins (1-0)

### Exchange 2: Hero 9, Bandit 16 → Bandit wins (1-1)

### Exchange 3: Hero 18, Bandit 12 → Hero wins (2-1) Victory!

## ⚔️ COMBAT VARIATIONS

This campaign includes many types of combat to keep things fresh:

# DIRECT DUEL

Hero vs. single opponent

Best of 3 or best of 5

Strength, Dexterity, or other relevant stat

## ⚔️ SKILL CHALLENGE

Navigate hazardous environment

Roll to avoid obstacles/dangers

First to 3 successes wins

# TIMED RACE

Outrun or outpace opponent

Series of Dexterity or Constitution rolls

Highest cumulative total wins

## ⚔️ BATTLE OF WITS

Social combat

Charisma or Intelligence rolls

Outsmart or outargue opponent

# GAUNTLET

Face multiple weaker opponents in sequence

Win each exchange to progress

Stamina challenge (Constitution)

# RIDDLE DUEL

Answer challenges correctly

Intelligence or Wisdom

First to 3 correct answers wins

[DM TIP: Describe combat vividly! When players win an exchange, describe their cool move. When enemies win, describe the counterattack. Make every roll feel like an action scene!]

## ⚔️ WHAT HAPPENS IF YOU LOSE COMBAT?

# REMEMBER: NO ONE DIES!

Instead, losing combat results in:

# FUNNY OUTCOMES

You slip in mud and the enemy laughs at you

You're disarmed and have to retrieve your weapon

You surrender and are briefly captured (but escape)

# NARRATIVE SETBACKS

You're delayed and have to take a longer route

You lose your chance to get bonus information

The opponent escapes with something minor

# ALTERNATE SUCCESS

You lose the fight but win their respect

You're beaten but find another solution

Someone else intervenes to help

## ⚔️ IMPORTANT: Even in "defeat," the story continues forward. No fight is a dead end.

[DM TIP: If a player is having terrible luck with rolls and losing repeatedly, let them find a creative solution that bypasses traditional combat. "You can't beat them in a fight... but maybe you could trick them instead?"]

# ACT I: THE HOWLING MOON TAVERN

> **DM NOTE:** [DM NOTE: This is where your adventure truly begins! Read the narration with energy and enthusiasm. This opening sets the tone for the entire campaign. Take your time, make eye contact with each player when you mention their character, and have fun with it!]

[SETUP: Make sure everyone is comfortable, has snacks and drinks, and is ready to play. Have the character sheets ready to distribute during the mirror scene.]

## 📋 OPENING NARRATION

### [DM reads with dramatic flair:]

"It is the height of summer, and warm evening breezes carry the scent of wildflowers and adventure through the village of Sunhaven. The most welcoming place for miles is The Howling Moon Tavern, where adventurers gather to share tales of glory, drink refreshing ale, and plan their next great quest under the long twilight of summer nights.

Tonight, four legendary heroes sit at a round wooden table near the crackling fireplace."

### [Pause, then gesture to yourself]

"You—the charismatic and devilishly handsome leader of this renowned party—have called your three most trusted companions together for a celebration."

### [Gesture to each player as you introduce them]

"At your side sits Christopher—a cunning ranger and treasure hunter, known across the land for collecting rare artifacts from the highest peaks, the deepest seas, and the endless skies. Tales speak of the time he recovered the Crown of Winds from a floating island, and the day he plunged into the Abyssal Trench to retrieve the Pearl of Depths."

"Beside him is Lena—a brilliant diplomat and investigator whose silver tongue and sharp mind have uncovered secrets that toppled kingdoms and saved lives. Her network of contacts spans every tavern, castle, and guild hall in the realm. She once talked down a dragon, negotiated peace between warring clans, and exposed a conspiracy that reached the highest levels of power."

"And completing your circle is Nick—a battle-hardened warrior whose name is whispered with respect on a hundred battlefields. A soldier who has never abandoned his brothers and sisters in arms. When the line needed to hold at the Battle of Crimson Valley, Nick held it. When the siege seemed impossible to break, Nick broke it."

### [Spread your arms wide]

"Together, you four have faced dragons, outwitted tyrants, and saved the realm more times than the bards can count. Tonight, you celebrate another year of survival, friendship, and adventure."

[DM TIP: Take a moment here to let that sink in. These aren't nobodies - they're HEROES. Make sure the players feel that.]

# INTRODUCING MAX & LUNA

### [DM continues with warmth and affection in your voice:]

"The Howling Moon Tavern is run by two of the most beloved innkeepers in all the land—Max, the silver-and-white Husky with piercing blue eyes and boundless energy, and Luna, the clever Aussiedor whose brown and white coat seems to shimmer in the firelight.

Max bounds between tables, his tail wagging furiously, delivering tankards of ale with a friendly bark. Luna works behind the bar with remarkable intelligence, somehow managing to pull pints and organize the shelves despite her lack of opposable thumbs.

The two of them have welcomed you here countless times, and they greet you now with excited barks and wagging tails."

## 📋 [DM INSTRUCTIONS:]

Show a picture of Max and Luna if you have one available

Play a sound effect of happy dog barking (optional but fun!)

Encourage players to react naturally - pet imaginary dogs, smile, engage with the scene

### INTERACTION POINT #1: Meeting the Dogs

### [DM prompts with playful energy:]

> ⚠️ "Max runs up to the table, nearly knocking over a chair in his excitement. He puts his paws up on [pick someone—let's say Christopher]'s lap, tail wagging like crazy, those blue eyes looking up expectantly."

[Give Christopher a moment to react - let him pet Max, say something to him, whatever feels natural]

"Luna barks from behind the bar—a sharp, intelligent sound that somehow conveys actual communication. Through a series of head tilts and paw gestures that you've learned to interpret over your many visits here, you understand she's asking: 'The usual for everyone?'"

### [Let players respond - they might call back, nod, give thumbs up, whatever feels right]

"The heroes are hungry and thirsty after their latest adventure. As each of you walks to the bar to order, you pass by an ornate mirror hanging on the tavern wall—its frame carved with symbols of adventure and heroism. Each one of you pauses for a moment, catching your reflection in the glass."

> ⚠️ [DM NOTE: This is the setup for character creation! Each player will look in the "mirror" and decide who their character really is.]

# CHARACTER CREATION: THE MIRROR MOMENT

> ⚠️ [DM NOTE: This is one of the most important moments! Hand out character sheets now. Give players time to really think about their choices. Don't rush this!]

### [DM to the whole table:]

"As you each look into the mirror, something magical happens. The reflection shows not just your face, but your very essence—your strengths, your weaknesses, the core of who you are as an adventurer. This is the moment to decide: What kind of hero are you?"

### [Hand out character sheets]

"Each of you has 12 SKILL POINTS to distribute across six abilities. These points represent your training, your natural talents, and your experiences. You can put them anywhere you want:"

### [Point to each stat on the sheet as you explain:]

### STRENGTH - Raw physical power. Can you lift boulders? Win arm wrestling? Hit hard in melee?

### DEXTERITY - Speed and precision. Can you dodge attacks? Pick locks? Shoot accurately?

### CONSTITUTION - Toughness and endurance. Can you outlast others? Resist poison? Keep going?

## ⚔️ INTELLIGENCE - Logic and knowledge. Can you solve puzzles? Recall lore? Outsmart enemies?

### WISDOM - Intuition and perception. Can you spot traps? Read people? Sense danger?

### CHARISMA - Force of personality. Can you persuade? Intimidate? Inspire? Lead?

### [Pause for questions, then continue:]

"You can distribute these 12 points however you want. Want to be incredibly strong? Put 12 in Strength! Want to be balanced? Spread them out evenly. Want to be smart and charming but not very strong? That works too! There's no wrong answer—just different types of heroes."

### [Go around the table, one at a time:]

"Nick— you're a warrior who's fought on a hundred battlefields. As you look in the mirror, what kind of warrior do you see? Where do you put your 12 points?"

### [Give Nick time to decide and fill out his sheet. Help him calculate modifiers if needed.]

"Christopher— you're a treasure hunter who's explored the heights and depths of the world. What skills have kept you alive? Where do you put your points?"

### [Give Christopher time. Be patient and helpful.]

"Lena— you're a diplomat and investigator who navigates the complex world of politics and secrets. What makes you so effective? Where do you excel?"

### [Give Lena time.]

### [After everyone finishes:]

"You step away from the mirror, each of you now fully aware of your capabilities. You ARE your character now. You know your strengths. You know where you excel. And you're ready for the adventure ahead."

[DM TIP: Have the modifier chart ready to help players calculate their bonuses. Make sure everyone understands: their point total determines their modifier, which they'll add to rolls.]

# [QUICK MODIFIER REMINDER:]

### INTERACTION POINT #2: Ordering Drinks

### [DM continues after character creation is complete:]

"With your identities now solidified, you approach the bar together. Max and Luna look up expectantly, ready to take your orders."

### [DM asks the table with enthusiasm:]

"What does your character order to drink tonight? What's your signature beverage?"

### [Go around the table, let each person name their drink. Have fun with this! Encourage creativity!]

### Some examples to inspire them:

Christopher might order: "Dragonfire Whiskey," "The Ranger's Respite," or "Skyfall Ale"

Lena might order: "Moonwell Wine," "The Silver Tongue" (a fancy cocktail), or "Ambassador's Reserve"

Nick might order: "Warrior's Brew" (a hearty dark ale), "Battlefront Bourbon," or "The Crimson Draft"

You (the leader) might order: "The Leader's Legacy," "Victor's Vintage," or whatever sounds fun

### [After everyone orders, describe the scene:]

"Max and Luna work together in perfect harmony—Max somehow fetches bottles in his mouth while Luna, through some mysterious canine magic, manages to pour drinks behind the bar. Within moments, your orders arrive at the table, carried carefully by Max who sets them down with barely a spill. He sits proudly, tail wagging, clearly expecting praise for his excellent service."

### [Give players a moment to thank/praise the dogs, pet them, whatever feels natural]

"Luna barks happily and returns to the bar, while Max curls up near the fireplace, content to watch over his favorite customers."

[DM TIP: These little moments of roleplay are important! They help players get comfortable speaking as their characters and interacting with the world. Don't rush through them.]

# THE TOAST

### [DM continues with building emotion:]

"The fire crackles warmly. Outside, the summer evening deepens into twilight. Inside The Howling Moon Tavern, you're surrounded by friends, good drink, and the comfortable feeling of being home. The four of you have been through so much together."

### [Stand up yourself, as the captured leader character, and raise your glass]

"You—" [gesture to yourself] "—the leader of this legendary party, stand up, raising your tankard high. The firelight glints off the ale as you prepare to give a toast."

[YOU deliver this toast as the leader character. Personalize it as you wish, but here's a suggested version:]

"My friends. My family. My battle-born companions."

### [Pause, make eye contact with each player]

"Another year behind us. Another year of impossible odds, narrow escapes, and victories snatched from the jaws of defeat. We've laughed together, bled together, and somehow—against all logic and probability—we've survived together."

### [Look at Christopher]

"Christopher, your cleverness has gotten us out of more traps than I can count. Every time we've been stuck, every time we've faced an impossible puzzle, every time we needed someone to find a way forward—you've been there."

### [Look at Lena]

"Lena, your wisdom has guided us when I had no answers. When diplomacy was required, when we needed to understand our enemies, when the path forward wasn't clear—your insight showed us the way."

### [Look at Nick]

"Nick, your strength has held the line when everything fell apart. When the situation looked hopeless, when we needed someone to stand firm, when we needed a warrior we could trust with our lives—you never wavered."

### [Raise your glass even higher]

"I am the luckiest leader in all the realms to call you my friends. To call you my family. Whatever comes next, whatever challenges we face, I know we'll face them together."

### [Final pause]

"To us. To friendship. To another year of adventure!"

### [Everyone raises their glasses]

"To adventure!" you all shout together!

### [Pause for everyone to "drink" together - clink glasses, take a sip, whatever feels right]

### [Optional: Play a brief sound effect of glasses clinking and tavern cheers if you have one]

[DM TIP: This toast is emotional and important. It establishes the bond between these characters. When the leader gets captured in a few minutes, this moment will make it MATTER. Take your time with it!]

# SHARING MEMORIES

### [DM narrates with a warm, nostalgic tone:]

"As you all sit back down, the warmth of the drink and the fire loosens tongues and opens hearts. The conversation naturally drifts to the adventures you've shared—the victories, the close calls, the moments that define your bond as a party."

### [INTERACTION POINT: Favorite Memories]

### [DM asks each player, going around the table:]

"[Player name], thinking back on this past year of adventures with this group, what's one moment that stands out to you? A battle won, a puzzle solved, a narrow escape, or even just a quiet moment around a campfire? What's one memory from our travels that you'll never forget?"

# [IMPORTANT DM NOTES:]

Give each player genuine time to answer—don't rush this!

These can be real memories from the past year together, or they can make something up based on their character

Encourage creativity and humor

React enthusiastically to each answer with affirmation and follow-up questions

This is bonding time—let it breathe

The goal is to get everyone comfortable roleplaying and feeling connected to their character

### [Example responses to encourage:]

"Remember when we fought that ice giant and Christopher shot an arrow right into his eye?"

"I'll never forget when Lena talked us out of being executed by the Queen with that incredible speech"

"That time Nick held the bridge alone against twenty bandits while the rest of us escaped with the villagers"

"When we got lost in the Whispering Woods and spent three hours arguing about which direction was north"

"That moment around the campfire when we thought the mission was hopeless, but we decided to try anyway"

### [After everyone has shared, describe the scene:]

"The tales flow as freely as the ale. Other patrons in the tavern have grown quiet, drawn in by your stories, listening with wide-eyed wonder to these legendary heroes.

Max has curled up by the fireplace, his tail occasionally thumping against the floor in contentment. Luna rests her head on the bar, watching you all with intelligent, affectionate eyes.

Hours pass. The fire burns lower, its embers glowing. The crowd thins as villagers head home to warm beds. Soon, it's just the four of you, Max, and Luna remaining in the tavern.

The night feels perfect. Complete. Like nothing could disturb this moment of peace and friendship."

### [Pause for effect, then shift your tone]

"And that's when everything changes."

[DM TIP: This transition is crucial. You're going from warm and cozy to ominous and dangerous. Change your voice—speak more slowly, more seriously. Build tension!]

# THE OMINOUS SHIFT

### [DM speaks with sudden gravity, pace slowing:]

"You're in the middle of a laugh when... something changes."

### [Pause. Let silence fill the room for a moment.]

"The fire flickers. The candles around the tavern dim—not blown out, but their flames shrinking as if something is draining their light. Your breath suddenly fogs in front of you. The temperature has dropped at least twenty degrees in an instant. Summer warmth replaced by winter cold in the span of a heartbeat."

### [Lower your voice]

"Max leaps to his feet from his spot by the fire, hackles raised along his back, a low growl rumbling from his chest—a sound you've never heard him make before. It's not playful. It's not warning. It's fear.

Luna's ears pin back flat against her head as she barks a sharp, urgent warning toward the tavern door. Her whole body is tense, ready to bolt or fight."

### [Optional: Play a sound effect of deep, ominous wind or distant rumbling]

### [INTERACTION POINT: Sensing Danger]

### [DM asks:]

"What do each of you do?"

### [Give players a moment to respond. They might:]

Reach for weapons

Look around for the source

Move to protect each other

Stand up alert

Ask what's happening

### [Accept any reasonable action and acknowledge it:]

"Christopher, you instinctively reach for your bow"

"Lena, you scan the room, trying to identify the threat"

"Nick, your hand goes to your sword hilt"

"You [the leader] stand, positioning yourself between your friends and the door"

### [Then continue:]

"Whatever you do, you're not fast enough. None of you are."

### [Build the drama]

"The tavern doors EXPLODE inward."

[Optional: Slam your hand on the table for dramatic effect—not hard enough to knock things over, just enough to startle]

# THE VOID TYRANT APPEARS

### [DM narrates with maximum drama and menace:]

"A blast of arctic wind howls into the tavern, extinguishing half the candles in an instant. Snow swirls through the open doorway, carried on unnatural winds.

And in that doorway stands a figure that makes your blood run cold.

It is cloaked in living shadows—darkness that writhes and pulses with malevolent energy, moving like smoke but solid as steel. The figure is tall, impossibly tall, having to duck beneath the tavern's doorframe.

Where its face should be, you see only emptiness—a void in the shape of a being. But its eyes... its eyes glow like dying stars, cold and merciless.

When it speaks, its voice sounds like a thousand whispers all screaming at once, layered and echoing, coming from everywhere and nowhere:"

### [Lower your voice to a menacing whisper, then gradually increase to a threatening tone:]

"'I have found you at last... the one who bound me centuries ago... the one who DARED to imprison THE VOID TYRANT in the Shadowspire Fortress!'"

### [The figure points directly at YOU, the leader character]

"'Your ancient magic may have trapped me then... but I have broken free. And now... NOW you will suffer as I have suffered. You will watch your precious realm crumble. You will watch your friends fail. And you will watch from a cage of shadow as I undo everything you've ever protected!'"

[DM TIP: Really commit to this villain voice! Make them scary but also theatrical—this is a villain who's been waiting centuries for revenge. They want to MONOLOGUE!]

[The leader (you) can respond here—maybe standing defiantly, maybe demanding to know how the Tyrant escaped, maybe calling them out. Improvise based on how you feel in the moment, but keep it brief—the Tyrant isn't here to chat.]

### [Continue after any brief leader response:]

"The Void Tyrant raises one shadowy hand. Tendrils of pure darkness spiral out from its form, reaching toward you [gesture at yourself as the leader] like grasping claws made of night itself."

### [Look at the three players]

"You three—Christopher, Lena, Nick—you're not just going to let this happen. Your friend, your leader, is being attacked! Instinct takes over!"

[DM TIP: Now we give the players a chance to try to help, even though they'll ultimately fail. This makes the capture feel earned and dramatic, not arbitrary.]

# THE DESPERATE RESCUE ATTEMPTS

### [DM addresses each player in turn:]

"This is happening FAST—you have only seconds to react before those shadow tendrils reach your leader!"

### [Each player gets ONE action attempt to save the leader. Go around the table:]

### "Christopher— what do you do?"

### [Let Christopher describe their action, then:]

"Roll a d20! Add your [relevant stat—probably Dexterity or Strength] modifier!"

### [Christopher rolls]

### [Based on the result:]

Roll 1-9: "You lunge forward, reaching out desperately, but the dark magic is too powerful! An invisible force slams you backward into the wall! You can only watch helplessly as the shadows wrap around your leader!"

Roll 10-19: "You manage to grab hold of your leader's arm! For a moment, for one precious moment, you're locked in a desperate tug-of-war with the darkness itself! You're actually holding on! But the magic is too strong—it tears your leader from your grip and hurls you backward across the tavern!"

Roll 20 (Natural 20): "You grab hold of your leader and for a precious instant, you HOLD ON! Your eyes meet! In that moment, they manage to gasp out words through gritted teeth:"

### [If Christopher rolls a 20, YOU (as the leader) say urgently:]

"'Find... the three paths... unite at the Shadowspire... don't give up!'"

"Then the magic rips you apart, and Christopher is thrown across the room!"

### "Lena— what do you do?"

### [Let Lena describe their action, then:]

"Roll a d20! Add your [relevant stat] modifier!"

### [Lena rolls]

### [Based on the result, use similar dramatic descriptions as above]

### "Nick— what do you do?"

### [Let Nick describe their action, then:]

"Roll a d20! Add your [relevant stat] modifier!"

### [Nick rolls]

### [Based on the result, use similar dramatic descriptions as above]

[If anyone rolled a Natural 20, they got the brief message. If multiple people rolled 20, they all heard it together. If no one rolled 20, they don't get the message yet—they'll learn the mission another way.]

### [After all three have tried and failed, continue:]

"The Void Tyrant's laughter fills the tavern—a sound like wind howling through empty tombs, like the death of hope itself.

The shadow tendrils coil around [your name as leader] completely, wrapping tighter and tighter until you can barely move.

Behind the villain, the very air tears apart—a swirling vortex of darkness opens, a portal to somewhere else, somewhere cold and terrible. Through the portal, you catch glimpses of stone walls, chains, and endless shadow. The Shadowspire Fortress."

### [YOU, as the captured leader, can struggle dramatically and call out:]

### [Suggested lines:]

"'Don't follow me! It's a trap! Save yourselves!'"

"'Find a way! I know you can!'"

or whatever feels right in the moment!

### [Then:]

"But your words are cut off as the Void Tyrant drags you backward into the portal. You reach out one last time toward your friends—"

### [Actually reach out toward the players dramatically, hand extended]

"—and then you're GONE."

### [Pull your hand back suddenly and sit down or turn away]

### [Optional: Play sound effect of whooshing wind and a thunderclap]

"The portal slams shut with a sound like thunder splitting the sky.

Silence falls over the tavern.

The temperature slowly returns to normal. The fire flickers back to life. The candles reignite.

But you three—Christopher, Lena, Nick—are left standing in the wreckage of the tavern, your leader gone, snatched away by an ancient enemy you didn't even know existed until two minutes ago.

Max whimpers, pawing at the spot where the portal vanished, looking back at you three with confused, worried eyes. Luna howls—a long, mournful sound that echoes through the empty tavern and out into the night."

### [Let this moment sit for a beat. Let the players process what just happened.]

[DM TIP: This is a heavy moment. The leader they just toasted is gone. Don't rush past it. Let the weight of it land.]

# THE MESSAGE

### [DM continues after a dramatic pause:]

"As you pick yourselves up from where the dark magic threw you—bruised, shaken, but alive—you notice something strange. Where the portal closed, something is appearing on the wooden floorboards. Words are burning themselves into the wood, glowing with an eerie purple light that pulses like a heartbeat."

### [Read this slowly and clearly, with ominous emphasis:]

# YOUR LEADER IS MY PRISONER IN THE SHADOWSPIRE FORTRESS.

# THREE KEYS WILL UNLOCK THEIR CHAINS:

## ⚔️ THE KEY OF POWER
Forged from victory on twelve battlefields

### THE KEY OF FORTUNE
Crafted from treasures of land, sea, and sky

### THE KEY OF KNOWLEDGE
Woven from secrets in towns and cities

# EACH OF YOU MUST WALK YOUR OWN PATH.

# ONLY WHEN ALL THREE KEYS ARE UNITED CAN YOU FACE ME.

# CHOOSE YOUR PATHS WISELY...

# ...OR YOUR LEADER DIES WHEN THE NEW MOON RISES.

# YOU HAVE SEVEN DAYS.

"The glowing words begin to fade. The purple light dims, flickers, and goes out. The words remain burned into the floorboards—a permanent reminder of the Void Tyrant's challenge."

[DM TIP: Give players a moment to absorb this. They might have questions. The key points are: three separate paths, three keys, they must work alone, limited time. Answer questions clearly but don't over-explain—some mystery is good!]

### [Players might ask:]

### "Can we go together?" → No, the magic prevents it—each path can only be walked by one

### "What happens if we fail?" → The leader dies and the Void Tyrant's power grows

## ⚔️ "How do we make the keys?" → By completing the challenges on each path

"Seven days?" → It's a magical deadline—they'll face twelve challenges, but won't take real-time days

# THE WAR COUNCIL

### [DM narrates:]

"Max and Luna approach you three, their playful energy gone, replaced by serious determination. Luna gently tugs at Nick's sleeve with her teeth, leading you all to a large round table in the center of the tavern. Max uses his snout to push aside tankards and plates until the table's surface is completely clear.

Then something magical happens."

### [Pause for effect]

"Luna barks three times—sharp, commanding. On the third bark, a map materializes on the table's surface, glowing with enchanted light. It shows the entire realm, rendered in perfect detail.

And from The Howling Moon Tavern—right here, where you stand—three distinct paths lead outward in different directions, each marked in a different color, all converging at a dark fortress in the center."

### [Describe with wonder]

"The Shadowspire Fortress. Your leader's prison. Your destination.

But you can't just march straight there—the paths wind and twist, each marked with twelve stops. Twelve challenges. Twelve encounters that must be completed to forge each key."

### [INTERACTION POINT: Understanding the Paths]

### [DM describes each path in detail:]

"Three paths shimmer before you, each calling to different skills, different strengths:

### THE CRIMSON PATH (glowing red)

This path cuts through battlefields, war zones, fortified castles, and proving grounds. The symbols along the route show swords, shields, flames, and battle standards.

This is the Warrior's Road—twelve trials of combat, strength, courage, and martial prowess. The challenges here will test your ability to fight, to stand your ground, to protect and to conquer.

### Complete this path, and you will forge THE KEY OF POWER.

### THE GOLDEN PATH (glowing gold)

This path winds through mountains, oceans, sky islands, ancient ruins, and hidden vaults. The symbols show treasure chests, flying ships, underwater grottos, and high peaks.

This is the Hunter's Route—twelve locations where legendary treasures wait, each guarded by unique challenges. Puzzles, traps, tests of agility and cleverness.

### Complete this path, and you will forge THE KEY OF FORTUNE.

### THE SILVER PATH (glowing silver)

This path weaves through towns, cities, taverns, guildhalls, noble courts, and bustling marketplaces. The symbols show crowns, quill pens, masks of drama, and speaking trumpets.

This is the Diplomat's Road—twelve social encounters where silver tongues and sharp minds are needed. Negotiations, investigations, persuasions, and clever conversations.

### Complete this path, and you will forge THE KEY OF KNOWLEDGE.

### [Let the descriptions sink in]

"All three paths end at the same place—the Shadowspire Fortress. But the roads to get there couldn't be more different."

[DM TIP: Make sure players understand: these aren't random assignments. They should choose the path that matches their character's style and the stats they invested in.]

# CHOOSING PATHS

### [INTERACTION POINT: The Most Important Choice]

### [DM speaks in character as Luna—somehow her thoughts appear in your minds:]

"Luna looks up at you three with impossibly intelligent eyes. Her voice appears directly in your minds, clear as a bell:

'The magic is clear and cruel. Each of you must walk one path alone. You cannot help each other on these journeys—the Tyrant's spell prevents it. You will face your challenges separately, walking parallel roads toward the same goal. But when all three keys are gathered at the Shadowspire... you will reunite. Stronger. Ready.'"

"Max barks in agreement, then sits attentively, looking between the three of you, waiting to see what you decide."

### [DM to the players:]

"Look at the map. Look at the three paths. Which one calls to you? Which path matches who your character is, what you're good at?"

### [Go around the table and let each player naturally choose. Guide them if needed:]

Nick - "The crimson path of battle calls to the warrior in you. Twelve battlefields await. Will you walk this road and forge the Key of Power?"

> ⚠️ Christopher - "The golden path of treasures speaks to the hunter in you. Twelve legendary treasures, hidden in the most dangerous places in the realm. Will you walk this road and forge the Key of Fortune?"

Lena - "The silver path of secrets and diplomacy whispers your name. Twelve challenges where words are more powerful than swords. Will you walk this road and forge the Key of Knowledge?"

### [After each player chooses their path:]

"As [player name] places their hand on their chosen path, it glows brighter, accepting them. The magic recognizes the match between hero and journey."

### [After all three have chosen:]

"The map shifts and changes before your eyes. Each path now shows greater detail—twelve distinct stops, twelve unique challenges, twelve encounters that stand between you and your key.

The routes are different, but the goal is the same: Save your leader. Defeat the Void Tyrant. Protect the realm."

> ⚠️ [DM NOTE: At this point, all three players have chosen. Nick has the Crimson Path (warrior challenges), Christopher has the Golden Path (treasure hunting), and Lena has the Silver Path (diplomacy). The stage is set for their separate adventures.]

# THE OATH

### [INTERACTION POINT: The Pledge]

### [DM to players with emotion:]

"Before you leave on your separate journeys, this might be the last time you see each other for a while. What do you say to one another? You won't meet again until the midpoint of your journeys, and then not again until you reach the Shadowspire with your keys."

### [Allow players to have this moment. Don't rush it. They might:]

Make promises ("I won't let you down")

Share words of encouragement ("You've got this")

Make a pact ("We meet at the Shadowspire, no matter what")

Reference their shared history ("Remember when we...")

Express worry or determination

Make jokes to lighten the mood

Clasp hands or embrace

[Let this moment breathe—it's emotional and important. These friends are separating for the first time in their adventuring careers.]

### [After they finish their farewells, continue:]

"Max and Luna walk each of you to the tavern door. Outside, the night has transformed. The summer evening is gone, replaced by something else—three distinct environments stretching out from the tavern's threshold, each corresponding to one of the paths.

Nick sees a road of packed red earth leading toward distant sounds of battle drums and the glow of war-fires on the horizon.

> ⚠️ Christopher sees a golden-lit trail that seems to rise into the air itself, leading toward mountain peaks shrouded in mist and mystery.

Lena sees a silver cobblestone street that winds toward a city whose lights twinkle in the distance, filled with life and secrets.

Three paths. Three heroes. One mission."

### [Luna places something in each player's hand—describe this individually:]

> ⚠️ "Luna approaches each of you in turn. In her mouth, she carries small crystals—each one glowing with the color of your path. She drops one into Christopher's hand (golden), one into Lena's hand (silver), and one into Nick's hand (crimson).

As you hold them, Luna's voice appears in your minds once more:

'These crystals are connected. When your tasks are half-complete, they will glow bright and open a portal—bringing you together for a brief reunion. This is my gift to you: you will not be alone forever. And when all three keys are forged, the crystals will unite and shine as one, opening the path to the Shadowspire together. Stay strong. Save our friend. The realm counts on you.'"

"Max howls—not in sorrow, but in encouragement. It's a sound of faith, of hope, of belief in these three heroes."

[DM TIP: This is deeply emotional. The players are about to be separated in the story. Make sure they feel the weight of it, but also the hope—they WILL reunite.]

# THE DEPARTURE

### [DM narrates the final moment of Act I:]

"You each take one last look at each other. Three heroes who have been inseparable, now about to walk separate paths. The weight of responsibility settles on your shoulders—your leader's life depends on your success. The realm's safety depends on you forging these keys. Everything depends on this.

But you're not facing it unprepared. You have your skills. You have your wit. You have your courage. And most importantly, you have each other's trust—even across the distance, you know your companions won't fail.

> ⚠️ Christopher turns toward the golden path, adjusting the pack of tools and weapons on his back, his eyes already scanning the mountains ahead for the first challenge.

Lena turns toward the silver path, her mind already working through strategies and possibilities, ready to navigate the complex world of politics and secrets that awaits.

Nick turns toward the crimson path, his hand resting on his sword hilt, his warrior's heart beating steady and strong, ready for whatever battles lie ahead.

And with the first light of dawn breaking on the horizon—"

### [Pause dramatically]

"—you each take your first step into destiny."

### [Let that moment breathe]

"Your separate adventures begin NOW."

> ⚠️ [DM NOTE: This is the end of the group prologue. From here, you'll run each player's cameo encounters in order: all of Nick's first (12-1), then all of Christopher's (12-1), then all of Lena's (12-1). The players will experience random encounters and spending encounters that happen "simultaneously" for everyone, and they'll reunite at the midpoint talent show with Max & Luna.]

[Take a brief break here if needed—grab snacks, stretch, use the bathroom. Then when you resume, announce:]

"We begin with Nick's journey along the Crimson Path. Christopher and Lena, your adventures are happening at the same time, but we'll experience Nick's story first. You're all walking your paths simultaneously in the story world."

[DM TIP: Make sure everyone understands the structure. All three journeys are happening at the same time in the story, but you're narrating them one at a time for gameplay clarity. This prevents confusion later!]
